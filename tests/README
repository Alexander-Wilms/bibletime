These directories are for tests of BibleTime classes and functions. They use
the Qt test framework as described in Qt documentaion. See QTest and qtestlib.

The tests for backend classes are not necessarily unit tests. Since many classes
are wrappers around sword functionality, it seems best to test classes based
on sword by including sword in the test program.


Building

The tests are automatically built in the build directory. They do not have to
be installed to run.


Running

The tests currently require the following modules to be installed.
KJV, KJVA, Scofield, Josephus, and StrongGreek

Running all test programs and summarizing the results can be done by running
"ctest" in the build directory. CMake provides the "ctest" program.

Running an individual test for a specific class is done by running the test
program for that class. This in normally "test_" plus the lowercase class name
like test_cswordversekey.


Errors

If an error occurs with an existing test, either there is a problem in the
BibleTime source or the test needs to be updated for the change in functionality.
Please keep all tests passing.
